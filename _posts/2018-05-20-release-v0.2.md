I have just released version 0.2, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.2).

Changes since version 0.1.1 include:

 - applying various fixes to the installation instructions in the manual;
 - adding form factors, observables and signal PDFs for the decays &Lambda;<sub>b</sub> &rarr; &Lambda;<sub>c</sub>(2595)&#8467;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nu;</span> and &Lambda;<sub>b</sub> &rarr; &Lambda;<sub>c</sub>(2625)&#8467;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nu;</span>
 - extending the existing BSZ2015 form factor parametrization to B&rarr;&rho and B&rarr;D<sup>*</sup> transitions
 - adding observables for the decay B&rarr;D<sup>*</sup>&#8467;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nu;</span> in generic New Physics models
 - replacing the built-in library of experimental constraints with YAML files that are loaded at run time;
 - switching to a nicer plotting framework for the ```eos-plot-1d``` and ```eos-plot-2d``` clients;
 - fixing a bug in the hierarchical clustering code that caused bad initial proposals for the first Population Monte Carlo (PMC) step;
 - fixing bugs in the ```configure``` script regarding non-standard installation locations;
 - adding support to propagate uncertainties from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results.
