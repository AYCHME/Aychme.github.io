I have just released version 0.3, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.3).

Changes since version 0.2.6 include:

 - fixing a bug in the calculation of &Lambda;<sub>b</sub>&rarr;&Lambda;&mu;<sup>+</sup>&mu;<sup>+</sup>;
 - fixing a bug when plotting univeriate Gaussian constraints;
 - changing the notation for meson name (```M^*_q``` to ```M_q^*``` throughout the code);
 - adding several constraints on B<sub>s</sub>&rarr;P and B<sub>s</sub>&rarr;V form factors;
 - unifying the code for B&rarr;D&#8467;&nu; and B&rarr;&pi;&#8467;&nu; decays;
 - improving parts of the documentation;
 - providing means to keep track of EOS references across observables.

Contributors of these changes are:
 - Christoph Bobeth
 - Thomas Blake
