I have just released version 0.3.1, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.3.1).

Changes since version 0.3 include:

 - speeding up the calculation of all ```SignalPDF``` by splitting evaluation from the normalization;
 - making the B&rarr;D<sup>(*)</sup> HQE form factors process (i.e. spectator quark flavour) dependent;
 - adding means to evaluate B<sub>q</sub>&rarr;D<sub>q</sub> BGL form factor coefficients in the HQE;
 - fixing some (non-physics) bugs in the evaluation of B<sub>s</sub>&rarr; D<sub>s</sub> &#8467; &nu; decays;
 - making various improvements to ```eos.Plotter```.

Contributors of these changes are:
 - Nico Gubernari
 - Stephan KÃ¼rten
 - Danny van Dyk
