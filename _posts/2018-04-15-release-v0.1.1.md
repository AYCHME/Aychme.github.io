I have just released version 0.1.1, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.1).

Changes to since version 0.1 include:

 - adding support for multidimension numerical integrals via the Cubature algorithm;
 - implementing model-indepdent NP contributions in B&rarr;D&#8467;&nu; decays;
 - exporting the <tt>Model</tt> class to the Python interface;
 - getting rid of the templated <tt>LogLikelihoodBlock::MultivariateGaussian</tt>,
   and replacing it with a class that handels the parameter size at run time.
 - providing active support for building and using EOS on MacOS X;
 - updating the manual and completing the part on software documentation, with help
   by Daniel Greenwald;


Contributors of these changes are:

 - Frederik Beaujean
 - Ahmet Kokulu
