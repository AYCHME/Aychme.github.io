I have just released version 0.2.3, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.2.3).

Changes since version 0.2.2 include:

 - improving ```eos.plot.Plotter``` to produce parametric plots;
 - updating the default parameters for all B&rarr;P and B&rarr;V form factors obtained in [GKvD2018];
 - updating the constraints and default parameters obtained from a combined fit to Lattice B-LCSR results for B&rarr;K<sup>&#42;</sup> form factors following the accepted revision of [GKvD2018].

Contributors of these changes are:
 - Nico Gubernari
 - Ahmet Kokulu
 - Stephan KÃ¼rten
