I have just released version 0.2.5, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.2.5).

Changes since version 0.2.4 include:

 - adding further observables and tensor NP effects for &Lambda;<sub>b</sub>&rarr;&Lambda;<sub>c</sub>&#8467;&nu; decays;
 - adding means to automatically generate lists of builtin constraints and parameters;
 - adding example Jupyter notebooks for two of the use cases;
 - adding a reinterpreted LHCb measurement of the &Lambda;<sub>b</sub> &rarr;&Lambda; &mu;<sup>+</sup>&mu;<sup>-</sup> branching ratio.
 - improving the Python interface with respect to plotting, logging and status reports;
 - improving the Python documentation;
 - fixing an import error on Python version below 3.6;
 - fixing warnings when loading YAML files with recent PyYAML versions;
 - fixing linker errors when linking against non-standard HDF5 libraries.
