I have just released version 0.2.6, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.2.6).

Changes since version 0.2.5 include:

 - changing some internal methods for computing the b&rarr;s Wilson coefficients;
 - speeding up likelihood evaluations by skipping blocks once one block yields and infinite result;
 - adding several new plot types to the Python interface;
 - completing the B<sup>(&#42;)</sup>&rarr;D<sup>(&#42;)</sup> form factors at order z<sup>2</sup>;
 - adding unitarity bounds for said form factors;
 - fixing a few errors in the Python plotting framework;
 - accounting for the universal electro-weak correction in B&rarr;D<sup>(&#42;)</sup>&#8467;&nu; decays.

Contributors of these changes are:
 - Nico Gubernari
 - Danny van Dyk
